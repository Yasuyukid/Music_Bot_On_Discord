# **Help:**

## Step 1: Create a bot.

- You can [click here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a new bot.
- You'll need to change the bot's scopes and permissions for it to work.
- Finally, create a new token then save it in a safe place as you will only see it once.

## Step 2: Install requirements.

- You can [click here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download ffmpeg.
- You also need to install other required libraries listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/YoutuberTom/Music_Bot_On_Discord/blob/main/Music_Bot/requirements.txt).

## Step 3: Modify config.

- Open the [config.ini](https://github.com/YoutuberTom/Music_Bot_On_Discord/blob/main/Music_Bot/config.ini) and change the config data.
- Replace **\<Path to ffmpeg>** with the path to ffmpeg.
- Replace **\<Bot's token>** with the bot's token that you've saved.

## Step 4: Enjoy.

- Now you can start using your self-hosted bot.
